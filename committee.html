        <h4 class="role">President and expeditions officer</h4>
	<p>I'm the president and expeditions officer for 2025/26, alongside being an assistant instructor. I learnt to dive with LUSAC back in 2023 as a fresher, and have since progressed to being a dive leader. I particularly enjoy planning trips for club members, and instructing, and my favourite diving has been along the south coast in Plymouth and Cornwall. Joining LUSAC has given me the opportunity to meet friends and mentors from all across the country, and it truly is a big family.</p>

        <h4 class="role">Secretary</h4>
	<p>I joined LUSAC last year, having never dived before. During my time at the club, I progressed to ocean diver in my first year and have since progressed to gain my sports diver qualification this year. I aim to gain my dive leader qualification in the hopes of eventually becoming an instructor myself. The club has a great community of people around who are always willing to help in any way they can. Whether it's helping out in the boatshed or instructing, there is always someone there to lend a hand when you get stuck.</p>

	<p>I’m Jen, the treasurer of the club for 2025/26. I learnt to dive with LUSAC in my first year of uni in 2023 while studying Maths with Ocean and Climate Sciences. I have since progressed to sports diver and hope to gain my dive leader in the future. I love being a part of the club as it’s a very supportive and friendly community where you get to meet people from all walks of life. My fave memories are from club trips where you get to do fun dives and spend time with friends from the club!</p>

        <h4 class="role">Social and Welfare Officer</h4>
	<p>Joining the club in 2024 allowed me to see the wildlife in it's natural habitat that I learn about in my marine biology degree. LUSAC have helped me to develop from a complete beginner to a sports diver, and perhaps one day an instructor. As social secretary and a member of the welfare team, I organise social events and help to mediate any disagreements in the club. I’d recommend learning to dive for anyone who gets the opportunity. Every dive is a memorable experience, developing a valuable skill as an ocean scientist.</p>

        <h3>Liam</h3>
        <h4 class="role">Diving Officer</h4>
	<p>Hi, I’m Liam, current DO of LUSAC and all-around dive enthusiast. Learning to dive has been, quite frankly, one of the most eye-opening and horizon-broadening choices in my life thus far. Scuba diving has taken me to some incredible parts of the world, and revealed parts of the UK that I never would have seen otherwise. It has unveiled a multitude of strange and wonderful creatures, and a concomitant appreciation for marine ecosystems. However, although marine life is a natural marvel that never gets old, it is wrecks that prove the greater marvel for me. Diving on wrecks has unlocked a tactile interaction with history, all packaged up in little adventures, which has certainly proved to be a welcome addition to my schedule of exploits. More peculiarly, due to taking up diving, it has also introduced me to a sport developed by scuba divers, aka underwater hockey, of which I’m now a very active player & referee. I’d strongly recommend everyone to give scuba & underwater hockey a go at least once…you never know, you may be one of the lucky ones to fall in love with it!</p>
