	<p>I'm the president and expeditions officer for 2025/26, alongside being an assistant instructor. I learnt to dive with LUSAC back in 2023 as a fresher, and have since progressed to being a dive leader. I particularly enjoy planning trips for club members, and instructing, and my favourite diving has been along the south coast in Plymouth and Cornwall. Joining LUSAC has given me the opportunity to meet friends and mentors from all across the country, and it truly is a big family.</p>

	<p>I joined LUSAC last year, having never dived before. During my time at the club, I progressed to ocean diver in my first year and have since progressed to gain my sports diver qualification this year. I aim to gain my dive leader qualification in the hopes of eventually becoming an instructor myself. The club has a great community of people around who are always willing to help in any way they can. Whether it's helping out in the boatshed or instructing, there is always someone there to lend a hand when you get stuck.</p>

	<p>I’m Jen, the treasurer of the club for 2025/26. I learnt to dive with LUSAC in my first year of uni in 2023 while studying Maths with Ocean and Climate Sciences. I have since progressed to sports diver and hope to gain my dive leader in the future. I love being a part of the club as it’s a very supportive and friendly community where you get to meet people from all walks of life. My fave memories are from club trips where you get to do fun dives and spend time with friends from the club!</p>

	<p>Joining the club in 2024 allowed me to see the wildlife in it's natural habitat that I learn about in my marine biology degree. LUSAC have helped me to develop from a complete beginner to a sports diver, and perhaps one day an instructor. As social secretary and a member of the welfare team, I organise social events and help to mediate any disagreements in the club. I’d recommend learning to dive for anyone who gets the opportunity. Every dive is a memorable experience, developing a valuable skill as an ocean scientist.</p>

	<p>I joined LUSAC to learn to dive in 2024, and quickly became enthralled. I achieved my Ocean diver in my first year, then progressed on to achieve my Sports diver in my second year. I've made many new friends in the club, as well as learning many new skills (I made this website) in my role of Marketing officer. The adventures, memories and skills made in this club are unrivalled.</p>

        <h3>Liam</h3>
        <h4 class="role">Diving Officer</h4>
	<p>Hi, I’m Liam, current DO of LUSAC and all-around dive enthusiast. Learning to dive has been, quite frankly, one of the most eye-opening and horizon-broadening choices in my life thus far. Scuba diving has taken me to some incredible parts of the world, and revealed parts of the UK that I never would have seen otherwise. It has unveiled a multitude of strange and wonderful creatures, and a concomitant appreciation for marine ecosystems. However, although marine life is a natural marvel that never gets old, it is wrecks that prove the greater marvel for me. Diving on wrecks has unlocked a tactile interaction with history, all packaged up in little adventures, which has certainly proved to be a welcome addition to my schedule of exploits. More peculiarly, due to taking up diving, it has also introduced me to a sport developed by scuba divers, aka underwater hockey, of which I’m now a very active player & referee. I’d strongly recommend everyone to give scuba & underwater hockey a go at least once…you never know, you may be one of the lucky ones to fall in love with it!</p>

	<p>Hi, I’m Rosie and I joined the club as a student when I was studying biology. Joining the club has been fantastic for my career as a marine biologist as it has enabled me to dive in the UK and gain real experience of observing UK habitats and species. The club has taught me so much, from progressing to instructor level, to learning to drive boats and importantly learning to interact with a wide range of people from different ages and backgrounds. It has taught me how to plan and lead groups and built my confidence - all skills which have helped in my career. Diving with LUSAC is some of the cheapest and best diving I’ve ever done, with real community spirit. I have held various committee positions over the years I’ve been in LUSAC, and spent countless hours in the boat shed filling cylinders. It is the kind of club where you get out the effort you put in, others volunteered their time to teach me to dive, and I am returning that favour to our current students.</p>

	<p>I'm Baxter, I have been diving since 2023, where I learnt to dive with a different BSAC club during a year in industry, then I joined LUSAC when I returned to university where I am currently a member of the committee acting as the equipment officer. My favourite things to see when diving are wrecks, and I hope to explore some more interesting wrecks on some of our upcoming trips.</p>

        <h3>Ionna</h3>
        <h4 class="role">Secretary</h4>
	<p>Hey, my name is Ioanna (Yanna for short). I joined LUSAC during the second semester of my first year as a diver, and then during my first semester of second year I joined Octopush, and now I’m Octopush captain. This club has always had a very welcoming vibe (one of the things I advertise when trying to convince people join, and they all agree). It also offers dive trips for a better price than you’ll get anywhere else. 

Octopush is not like any sport I’ve ever played before, but it is so worth it. As a kid I played roller-hockey (due to the lack of ice/ice-rinks where I lived), and always liked hockey variants. The atmosphere of the octopush team is so friendly and everyone is always joking around. It helped me develop longer breath holding and stamina which I used for my other sports. It also combined some of my favourite things, swimming, hockey and being underwater. Totally worth it - 10/10 sport.
