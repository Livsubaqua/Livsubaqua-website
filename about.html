                    <h1>Who we are</h1>
                    <p>Liverpool University Sub Aqua Club (LUSAC) is a student-led dive club affiliated with the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC branch 280) and the University of Liverpool Athletic Union.
We are proud to be one of the largest and most active BSAC university branches in the UK, with a jam-packed calendar of dive and octopush training, dive trips, and social events running throughout the year.
Whether you’ve never tried scuba diving before or you’re already qualified, LUSAC offers a welcoming, supportive environment to develop your skills, meet new people and explore the underwater world.

                    <h1>Equipment & Facilities</h1>
                    <p>
LUSAC is exceptionally well-equipped for our members. We own:
●	2 RHIBs
●	2 compressors (including one petrol-driven compressor for transportable use across the country - also allows our members to have free unlimited air fills)
●	A large range of dive equipment available for members to borrow

Learning to dive with a university club remains one of the most affordable ways to gain qualifications — and our extensive, easily borrowable equipment makes getting started even more accessible.

                    <h1>Our Community</h1>
                    <p>Our membership ranges from 18-year-old first-year students to members in their mid-70s. The strong community we foster means many alumni return long after graduating to dive, train and play our sport, octopush.
LUSAC isn’t just about diving — it’s about building lifelong friendships and being part of a passionate, supportive community.

                    <h2>Underwater Hockey</h2>
                    <p>In addition to scuba diving, LUSAC also plays octopush — an underwater hockey sport played in the pool using snorkels, masks and short sticks to push a puck along the bottom.
Octopush is fast-paced, tactical and great fun. It’s an excellent way to build water confidence, improve breath control and stay dive-fit throughout the year.
We run regular octopush sessions during pool nights, and members of all abilities are welcome — no prior experience required.
For many members, octopush becomes just as much a highlight of the club as diving itself.
