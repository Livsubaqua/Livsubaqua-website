Hello there. I am Will - the almighty creator (of this website). You now hold the keys to this masterpiece of club legacy now, you are responsible for updating stuff. Enjoy. 
If you have ever done any coding, you will be fine. If not, don't be overwhelmed because it's pretty easy once you know what you're looking for. Most of the stuff shouldn't need touching (unless you're into that?) especially the .css file (determines layout and appearance) you can if you want, but idk why you would need to unless you make big changes to the site. 

Start of each academic year.
The main section that requires a lot of work initially is the committee section (you just get THEM to write a bio and pick a picture and YOU copy and paste into the framework. You need to save the images into the GitHub repository and then just make sure you put the right name for everything in the right place (there is also an abridged version of the bio of the president, vice-pres and secretary at the bottom of the 'about us' page).

Keeping the site up to date. 
There are only 2 things to keep up to date (I hope for both of our sakes there is only 2). The Blog and the calendar. The calendar should be easy, you can probably just run it from your phone. When you see a trip get released, just put it on the google calendar on the livsubaqua.marketing@gmail.com account (Sorry that email is so long, completely my fault). The blog shouldn't be too hard either, I got a large group of peopple to write Blogs for me (but we had nothing before so there is a backlog). I reckon its your job now to write blogs (but if you're not on the trip, I give you permission to get someone on the trip to write it. 

Here is the instructions to make banana bread

End note.
I feel as though our time together is coming to a close. Alas i have runneth out of things to say and I think I have rambled enough.My Final words to my successors: this responsibility is  your's to bear, and it's a great one. YOU and you alone have final say about what apears on the 'University of Liverpool Sub-Aqua Club' website. Use it wisely.
